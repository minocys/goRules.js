## goRules.js ##
  GO rules as a Node.js module. 

## Summary ##
  This is an implementation of Go rules in vanilla javascript, made into a node module for easy plug and play.

## Problem ##
  Currently available implementations of GO rules are have not been updated recently, or come prepackaged with visualization code.

## Solution ##
  goRules.js is just an implementation of the rules. My aim is to provide the game logic for your implementation with minimal code-reading, and to provide a clear base for easy customization
